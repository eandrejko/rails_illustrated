# How the Little Details Add Up to the Customer Experience

![Rebates](/posts/rebates.jpg) Apple seems to really understand the retail experience.  When I bought a computer at the Apple Store to replace my wife's notebook included was a free printer.  Of course as is often the case you first pay for the printer and then send in for a rebate.  Usually this would set of some alarm bells.  In this case I filled out the rebate form, online, with the help of the sales representative.  I have the check in my hand about one week later.  Why can't anyone else figure this out?

## The usual experience

1. Leave the store with several things to do i.e. homework.
1. Cut out UPC.
1. Photocopy receipt.
1. Send everything in the mail to third party.
1. Wait and hope the check arrives.

## The Apple experience

1. Fill out a web form with the help of the employee.
1. Leave with nothing else to do.
1. Receive an email saying that the rebate is being process and will be sent soon.
1. Check in hand one week after purchase.

## Setup to fail

Most retailers are set up to fail with rebates.  They can offer the customer a web form but they can't allow the customer to fill out the form before leaving.  Can you imagine filling out a form while people wait behind you in the checkout line?  Furthermore the usually have the rebate experience totally out of their control in the hands of some third party.

By changing the retail experience Apple has given itself room to polish many of the seemingly small details.  Each of these adds up to a great experience overall.
