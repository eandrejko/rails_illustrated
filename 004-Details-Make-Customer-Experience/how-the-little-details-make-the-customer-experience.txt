# How the Little Details Add Up to the Customer Experience

![Rebates](/posts/rebates.jpg) Apple seems to really understand the retail experience.  When I bought a computer at the Apple Store to replace my wife's notebook included was a free printer.  Of course as is often the case you first pay for the printer and then send in for a rebate.  Usually this would set of some alarm bells.  In this case I filled out the rebate form, online, with the help of the sales representative.  I have the check in my hand about one week later.  Why can't anyone else figure this out?
