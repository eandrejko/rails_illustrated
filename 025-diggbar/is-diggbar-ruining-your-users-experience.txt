# Is the Diggbar Impacting Your User's Experience?

![Diggbar](/posts/diggbar.jpg)

The recently launched Diggbar from [digg.com](http://digg.com) can wrap your site in a frame if the user visits a special URL on digg.com.  Your user's experience is negatively impacted:

- the URL in the address bar is 'digg.com'
- your site title could be changed
- content is moved down the page (leaving less 'above the fold')
- it adds visual noise to your site
- it changes your finely crafted visual design
- your site's personality is affected

Many sites (like the [NY Times](http://nytimes.com)) are, with good reason, [blocking this Diggbar](http://daringfireball.net/2009/04/how_to_block_the_diggbar).  There is a Rails plugin to do this for your site: [acts_against_douchebar](http://github.com/sandofsky/acts_against_douchebar/tree/master).
